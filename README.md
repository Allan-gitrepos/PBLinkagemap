PBLinkagemap
PBLinkagemap is a web application for interactive creation of linkage maps and identification of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) from genomic and phenotypic datasets.

Access the app here: allanbiotools1.shinyapps.io/PBLinkagemap/

Overview
PBLinkagemap provides an easy-to-use graphical interface for QTL mapping. Users can upload their own datasets and configure parameters to:

Construct linkage maps based on recombination fractions and LOD scores
Identify QTLs associated with traits of interest
Visualize QTL locations and candidate genes
Explore marker-trait associations through interactive charts
The goal is to streamline genetic mapping of quantitative traits from experimental or breeding populations. Both bi-parental and multi-parent populations are supported.

Usage
Please see the Usage Guide on the web app homepage for details on data formats, parameters, and usage instructions.

Several example datasets are also provided to get started quickly.
